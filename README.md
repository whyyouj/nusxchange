# NUSXchange 🏫
Welcome to NUSXchange, a one-stop platform for everything related to the NUS Student Exchange Program!

### Motivation 🤔
We were frustrated with the confusing process of applying to SEP. Information such as module mapping, number of slots, application dates were all scattered across the Internet! We felt NUS SEP should not be a hassle to apply for. Hence, we strove to make a centralised, all-in-one platform to let students make informed, strategic decisions about their exchange.

### Project Summary 📝
NUSXchange is a web-based platform that provides students with easy access to information about the NUS student exchange program, as well as a forum to connect current and past exchangers. Our platform offers the following features:

1. Information about partner universities
2. Details about the application process
3. Module Mapping Tool for partner universities
4. A forum for students to communicate with each other
5. Exchange of Telegram Handles of fellow exchangers
With these features, we aim to provide a comprehensive platform that helps students plan their exchange program effectively.

### Technologies 🏗  
NUSXchange is built using the following technologies:

- Firebase for hosting the website and database (Cloud Firestore)
- Vue.js for the frontend framework


### Deployment & Showcase 🚀
NUSXchange is hosted on Firebase and is available here. You can access all the features and functionalities of the platform by signing up for an account.

We have also created a showcase video that highlights the features of NUSXchange, which is available on Youtube. We encourage you to watch the video to learn more about the platform and its features.

Thank you for choosing NUSXchange for all your NUS student exchange program needs!
